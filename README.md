###User our "Related Items Customization" to Increase Sales in Acumatica!

BJ Dimes and Bill Dimes completed the coding and made all features functional:

1. Create related items in both Stock and Non-Stock item forms
2. Use the "Add Related Items" button to display items related to the item on the selected sales order body line
  * View related items stock status in pop-up
  * Filter to items that are in-stock
  * Filter to a relationship type (Companion or Replacement)
  * Use the checkboxes or quantities to add one or more related items to the sales order
3. The Related Item Generic Inquiry is in Distribution/Inventory/Work Area/Explore
4. The Parent-Child and Child-Parent reports have been formatted and are in Distribution/Inventory/Reports/Audit
5. A Wiki is included with documentation in Help/HAT Related Items/Related Items

Note that all source code, reports, generic inquiry, wiki, and site map changes are included in the customization package.  Simply import and publish the package!
